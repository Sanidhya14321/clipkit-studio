# Implementation decisions

- Preserve the JSON-first local architecture. The server serializes all mutations, durably appends a journal entry before replacing the snapshot, and recovers an interrupted snapshot from the journal.
- Persist runtime leases separately from undoable content. A lease has owner, token, turn ID and expiry; every agent mutation is checked. Browser lock styling is only a convenience, never the enforcement boundary.
- Use native timeline items with `at`/`dur` and source-relative `srcIn`; caption words are mapped from immutable source transcripts. Cut boundaries are validated and quantized. Cut audio is cached with short fades.
- Use a real child-process runner. MCP registration alone cannot send work to a client. Codex runs read-only at the filesystem level and edits via authenticated ClipKit MCP tools; its activity and actual committed layer IDs are visible.
- Use original deterministic native clip implementations rather than copying unaudited template repositories. Keep twelve license-verified asset/reference sources and vendor a curated subset with pinned hashes. An unavailable template source is documented as rejected rather than labeled MIT without evidence.
- Package internal server/CLI code into one executable bundle and include a separate source tree for Remotion bundling. Runtime workspace dependencies are not published separately.
- Do not use the already-registered npm name `clipkit`. Deliver `clipkit-studio-local` as a local tarball; public publishing is outside this build.
- Fish requests are real and use explicit model headers. Cache TTS before provider calls. Store mode-specific voice references, not a shared reference that could silently mix AI and cloned voices.
- Never infer individual word times from phrase-level ASR. Keep the transcript text but disable destructive word editing if timings are unreliable.
- Preserve true audio duration when outside the 8% fitting tolerance; flag the mismatch and let the human adjust the slot window. The app does not silently accelerate narration to arbitrary durations.
- Use one 720x1280 30fps H264/AAC preset. The renderer snapshots the revision and uses locally served original media; proxies are preview-only.
- Token estimates use UTF-8 bytes divided by four and are explicitly labeled estimates. Actual client usage, when emitted, is separate. There is no fixed savings number.
- The user supplies a Fish key, real talking-head footage and a consented voice recording. Missing external inputs cannot be replaced by simulated successes. Test fixtures use visible test patterns and tones.

## Document verification on 26 October 2026

The later supplied Word brief contains 79 verification criteria and added hackathon requirements. The feature audit is in docs/PRD-FEATURE-AUDIT.md. This task authorizes verification and public repository creation, not implementation of missing PRD features, so the audit leaves runtime code unchanged.

The audit records unresolved defects in cut-audio restoration, trim bounds, patch-driven lease renewal, pack-license validation, transcript budgets and baseline accounting. These require repair before claiming a full raw-footage demo. Earlier green unit tests and native render proofs cover a reduced MVP rather than all acceptance conditions. General packs, selective revert, expanded voice controls, Cursor integration and pitch/comparison assets remain incomplete or deferred; missing Fish credentials, human speech samples and Claude sign-in block the corresponding live checks.
