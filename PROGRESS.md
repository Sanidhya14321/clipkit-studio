# Progress

## Handoff (latest)
1. Done: Phase 0 setup; Phase 1 steps 1-3 (deps, error codes, project model with validation). Workspace skeleton (9 crates, no logic), CLAUDE.md, spec split + INDEX.md, 8 skills, 4 subagents, 4 hooks + settings, justfile, CI, fixtures generator.
2. Proof: `just check` green locally (fmt, clippy, 2 tests, 41 hook payload tests); see VERIFICATION.md.
3. Open: fixtures generator not run locally (ffmpeg missing; `sudo apt install ffmpeg`, then `just fixtures`); CI not yet run (nothing pushed).
4. Next: Phase 1 step 4 (timeline math), then patches, history, storage, migrations, locks, stage machine, logging.
5. Start: `/clear`, then the Phase 1 message from docs/spec/13-kickoff.md ("Use the phase-runner skill for Phase 1 ...").

## Phase 1: core (2026-10-28) - approved, in progress (steps 1-3 done)

Spec: 02 (2.2), 03 (3.2, 3.3), 04 (4.1, 4.2), 10 (10.1, 10.4). Proof: heavy unit + property tests green.

Steps (each ends with `just check`):
- [x] 1. Deps: serde, serde_json, json-patch, schemars, thiserror, tracing (+ tracing-subscriber in ck-cli), dev: proptest, insta, tempfile. Versions verified >= 2 weeks old, recorded in DECISIONS.md.
- [x] 2. `ck-core::error`: `ErrorCode` enum (E_STAGE, E_LOCK_HELD, E_PATCH_STALE, E_PATCH_INVALID, E_SCHEMA, E_STORAGE, E_MIGRATION, E_RETRY, ...) with stable string codes + hints; `CkError`. Snapshot test pins every code.
- [x] 3. `ck-core::model`: Project, Source, Track, Item (footage/clip/voice/audio/caption + common fields), VoiceSlot, Comment, Brief, Pipeline, Agent, Locks (spec 3.2), `schemaVersion`. Serde camelCase + JsonSchema; insta snapshot of the JSON Schema; round-trip proptest.
- [ ] 4. `ck-core::timeline`: seconds <-> frames, item spans, overlap detection. Proptests.
- [ ] 5. `ck-core::patch`: apply RFC 6902 patch with `baseRev` + per-layer revs; validate result against the model; stale -> E_PATCH_STALE listing only changed layer ids; bump project rev and touched item revs. Inverse patch computed by diff.
- [ ] 6. `ck-core::history`: append-only revision log (author, label, timestamp, touched layer ids, forward + inverse patch); undo/redo as NEW revisions (history never rewritten). Proptest: apply then undo == original; undo then redo == applied; random sequences keep rev monotonic.
- [ ] 7. `ck-core::storage`: `.clipkit/` layout, atomic write (temp, fsync, rename, dir fsync), one history file per rev, load + replay check. Tests with tempfile, including a crash leftover temp file.
- [ ] 8. `ck-core::migrate`: versioned migration chain; v0 fixture project (no schemaVersion) loads as v1. Test that every older fixture loads.
- [ ] 9. `ck-core::locks`: per-layer locks for agent or human, heartbeat, expiry via injectable clock; human edits refused while agent holds the layer (E_LOCK_HELD). Proptests on random lock/heartbeat/expire sequences.
- [ ] 10. `ck-pipeline::stage`: stage machine for spec 4.1 (BOOT..ITERATE, passes in order), operation -> allowed-stage table, E_STAGE with hint naming the next allowed step, brief-auto exception; retry gate (same failing call + args refused after two attempts, E_RETRY). Exhaustive transition tests.
- [ ] 11. Logging: standard field names (trace_id, run_id, turn_id, stage, pass, layer_id, rev) and secret redaction in `ck-core::log`; JSON subscriber init in `ck-cli`. Test captures a log line and checks fields + redaction.
- [ ] 12. VERIFICATION.md evidence, rust-reviewer + spec-checker subagents, DECISIONS.md, handoff, commit.

Out of scope for Phase 1 (later phases): scope, budget, destructive, quality and honesty gates (Phases 4, 6, 8); props-schema validation for clips (Phase 4); TS type generation (Phase 2); CLI/MCP commands (Phase 2).

## Phase 0: setup (2026-10-28)

Plan (approved by the owner before building):
- [x] Archive the Codex implementation to branch `codex-archive`; clean `main`; move gitignored leftovers out of the repo.
- [x] Check current Claude Code docs for memory, skills, subagents, hooks, settings; record in DECISIONS.md.
- [x] Copy the prompt to docs/MASTER_PROMPT.md; split it into docs/spec/ with `scripts/split-spec.py`; write INDEX.md.
- [x] Cargo workspace skeleton: 9 crates from spec 3.1, pinned toolchain, workspace lints, nextest config.
- [x] Placeholder folders: studio/, render-worker/, plugin/, adapters/, assets/quarantine/, fixtures/.
- [x] CLAUDE.md (55 lines).
- [x] Skills: spec-lookup, phase-runner, rust-conventions, studio-frontend, media-ffmpeg, asset-pipeline, testing-and-evidence, debug-triage.
- [x] Subagents: test-runner, spec-checker, rust-reviewer, researcher.
- [x] Hooks: format-file (PostToolUse), guard-edits and guard-bash (PreToolUse), stop-check (Stop); permissions in .claude/settings.json.
- [x] Hook payload tests: tests/hooks/run.sh.
- [x] justfile: check, check-fast, test, fmt, studio-dev, e2e, fixtures, bench, split-spec.
- [x] CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml (fast suite + fixtures job).
- [x] Fixtures generator: fixtures/generate.sh -> fixtures/generated/ with ground-truth.json.
- [ ] Run the fixtures generator locally (BLOCKED: ffmpeg not installed).
