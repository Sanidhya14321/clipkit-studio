# Pipeline update verification

Existing release evidence and pending human acceptance remain in [docs/VERIFICATION.md](docs/VERIFICATION.md). This file tracks only the pipeline update; fixture checks do not certify aesthetic quality or live voice providers.

U0: audited current working tree, source receipts, schema, CLI, MCP and workflows in UPDATE_AUDIT.md. No application code changed in U0.
U1: additive AssetKnowledge uses existing UsageCatalogSchema and leaves catalog.json/instructions/pack loading compatible. Generated cards preserve reviewed cards and owner notes. Verification pending U8.
